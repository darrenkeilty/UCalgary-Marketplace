1. From the command line, move into the folder you would like the git repository to reside in.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darrenkeilty/UCalgary-Marketplace.git
```
3. Move into to the folder: seng513-202401-group-15

5b.But you must leave the `EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS` as is so you have access to our gmail account. In order to share our project, we were unable to keep these secrets a secret. 
6. Run the following command. Note that the -d option prevents you from being bombarded with logs when creating the containers:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

7.  Once the containers are set up you should see something like this in the terminal. It will take around 30s for the Database to set up so please wait until you see this screen. 
```bash
$ docker compose up -d
